# UILayout

UILayout is a simple, peformant, layout-based, cross-platform user interface library.

# Platforms Supported

UILayout currently supports SkiaSharp and MonoGame as underlying rendering systems. As such, it has the ability to target the same platforms they do - so most platforms are potentially supported.

# Functionality

UILayout provides the following:

- Layout structure (dock, horizontal/vertical stacks, etc.)
- UI controls (buttons, text blocks, sliders, menus, dialogs, etc.) 
- Image rendering (images, ninepatch images, batching, image atlases)
- Font rendering (skia text rendering, bitmap fonts)
- Mouse/Keyboard input handling
  
# Current Status

UILayout is currently under active development and everything is very much subject to change.

That said, it already provides considerable functionality and is being used in several large projects.
