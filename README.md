# UILayout

UILayout is a simple, peformant, layout-based, cross-platform user interface library for .NET languages.

# Platforms Supported

UILayout currently supports SkiaSharp and MonoGame as underlying rendering systems. As such, it has the ability to target the same platforms they do - so most platforms are potentially supported.

Tested platforms:
- Windows x64
- Linux x64

- Font rendering (skia text rendering, bitmap fonts)
- Mouse/Keyboard input handling
- File dialog support

# Getting Started

# Current Status

UILayout is currently under active development and everything is very much subject to change.

That said, it already provides considerable functionality and is being used in several large projects.
